Notes
===
* For a quick demonstration run index.php through a PHP7.x CLI
* PHP 7.x as the runtime interpreted language
* Composer for dependency management of:
    * rollbar (hosted error tracking software)
        * Exceptions thrown (of any type) will report the error to rollbar, which is an online error tracking platform.
    * phpunit
* Coding style PSR
* To run a phpunit unit test (after composer install) run (from the project root) `vendor/bin/phpunit` and see the test output.
