Introduction
===
A very brief attempt at a PHP challenge. Time-constraints have meant that I have not completed all requirements.

How to run
===
Using PHP 7 parse index.php

To-do
===
* Implement a set of standardized validators. Right now we just have very basic type checks on the setters and no validation on returned JSON. This was written quickly!
* Implement character & movie models with links to each other.
* Write unit tests.
* Integrate an exception handling library like AirBrake.

What I did
===
Provided a very quick demonstration of OO basics; abstraction, interfaces, scope and a couple of the newer features in PHP7.

What I didn't have time to do
===
See To-do for a brief summary.
